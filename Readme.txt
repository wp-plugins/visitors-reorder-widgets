== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should someone install this plugin at all?

The plugin is mostly usefull on vertical large websites where users need ocasionally a widget that is located down in the sidebar.

= What if my website has both left and right sidebar?

In that case you need to place only one unit of this widget.

= Why not supporting the footer?

Since scrolling to the footer would cause your visitor to leave the main content in any case and no advantage would have been acheived.
